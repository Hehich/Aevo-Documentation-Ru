# Introduction to Earn Vaults

## What are Earn Vaults?

Earn Vaults are a new line of yield vaults, designed to have a risk profile complementary to Theta vaults. It's an all-weather yield product that offers principal protection and uses a combination of lending and exotic options to enhance yields through exposure to short-term volatility in the market.

It employs fully funded strategies through which depositors can capitalize on the intra-week ETH movements, while also ensuring their capital is protected.&#x20;

Earn is new line of vaults, so more variants will soon follow.
