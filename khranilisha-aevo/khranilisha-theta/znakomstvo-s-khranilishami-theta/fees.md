# Fees

The vault fee structure consists of a 2% annualised management fee and a 10% performance fee.

If the weekly strategy is profitable, the weekly performance fee is charged on the premiums earned and the weekly management fee is charged on the assets managed by the vault. Please notice that the profitability is evaluated regardless of the expiry of the weekly options. In the unlikely event that the options expire ITM but the vault still makes a profit (i.e., if the weekly premium is able to absorb the loss), commissions will still be charged.

If the weekly strategy is unprofitable, there are no fees charged.
