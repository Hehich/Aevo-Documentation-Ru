# Redemptions

You can withdraw simply by clicking “Redeem” in the Aevo Savings Collateral section in [https://app.aevo.xyz/portfolio](https://app.aevo.xyz/portfolio). Shares are automatically burned and you will receive USDC immediately!

**Note:** in the case where the USDC buffer is insufficient to cover your withdrawal, your withdrawal will be initiated and no further action needs to be taken. Rebalances are performed on a daily basis, so your USDC will automatically be credited to your account once the next rebalance is performed.
